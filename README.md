🦠 COVID-19 Data Analysis Project Report

Beginner-Level Python Data Analysis Project

Prepared by: Gaurav Kevat
Course: B.Tech (Lateral Entry) – CSE (Data Science)
Year: 2026

1️⃣ Project Overview 🌍

This is my first hands-on data analysis project using Python.
The project analyzes real COVID-19 data to understand case trends and rates using visual graphs.

2️⃣ Problem Statement ❗

Raw COVID-19 data in CSV format is difficult to understand without analysis and visualization.

Project Goals 🎯

Analyze confirmed, recovered, and death cases

Calculate recovery and death rates

Identify trends over time

3️⃣ Dataset Description 📂

File Name: Covid_Data.csv

Main Columns:
Date, Country/Region, Confirmed, Recovered, Deaths

Data Cleaning Steps 🧹

Missing values handled

Duplicate records removed

Column names standardized

4️⃣ Tools & Technologies Used 🛠️

Python (core language)

Pandas (data handling)

Matplotlib & Seaborn (graphs)

Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

5️⃣ Step-by-Step Implementation 🧑‍💻

Loaded dataset using Pandas

Cleaned and prepared data

Calculated:

Recovery Rate = (Recovered / Confirmed) × 100

Death Rate = (Deaths / Confirmed) × 100

Created bar, line, and pie charts

Uploaded final project to GitHub

6️⃣ Results & Key Insights 📈

Recovery and death rates calculated successfully

Graphs showed clear trends during peak periods

High confirmed cases did not always mean high deaths

Visual analysis improved data understanding

7️⃣ Challenges Faced ⚡

Understanding real-world data structure

Cleaning inconsistent data

Debugging Python and Pandas errors

8️⃣ Learnings & Skills Gained 🏆

Python and Pandas basics

Data cleaning techniques

Data visualization

Analytical and debugging skills

9️⃣ Problem Solved by This Project ✅

This project converted raw COVID-19 data into clear and meaningful insights using Python.

🔟 Limitations ⚠️

Data based on public reporting

Population and testing data not included

1️⃣1️⃣ Future Scope 🚀

Use real-time data through APIs

Create interactive dashboards

Add basic prediction models

1️⃣2️⃣ Conclusion 🏁

This project built my foundation in Python-based data analysis and increased my confidence in working with real datasets.

1️⃣3️⃣ Interview Explanation 🎤

“I analyzed COVID-19 data using Python, cleaned the dataset, calculated recovery and death rates, and visualized trends.”

🎯 Recruiter Note 💼

A simple beginner-to-intermediate project demonstrating the complete data analysis workflow using Python.
