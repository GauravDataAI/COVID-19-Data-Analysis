## COVID-19 Data Analysis Project Report 🦠

### Beginner Python Project on Data Analysis & Visualization 🐍📊

---

## Project Information 📌

* **Prepared By:** Gaurav Kevat
* **Course & Specialization:** B.Tech (Lateral Entry) – CSE (Data Science)
* **Date / Year:** 1 January 2026

---

## COVID-19 Data Analysis Using Python 🐍

* Analyze confirmed, recovered, and death cases
* Calculate recovery and death rates
* Visualize trends using charts and graphs

---

## 1️⃣ Project Overview 🌍

* Background: Raw COVID-19 data is large and hard to read
* Objective: Analyze COVID-19 data, calculate key metrics, visualize trends
* Learning Approach: Hands-on “learning by doing” using real-world data

---

### AI Usage Note 🤖

* **Purpose of AI:**

  * Used only to generate Python code snippets
  * Did not write logic, analysis, or workflow

* **What I Did Manually:**

  * Understood the code, modified it, and applied it correctly 🧠
  * Wrote additional Python code where needed 🐍
  * Cleaned, processed, and analyzed the data 📊
  * Created all charts and visualizations 📈
  * Saved project files and uploaded to GitHub 💾

* **Why This Matters:**

  * Shows real understanding of Python & Pandas
  * Demonstrates problem-solving, debugging, and analytical skills
  * Confirms end-to-end project ownership

* **Quick Note for Recruiters:**

  * ChatGPT = used only for coding assistance
  * Everything else (logic, analysis, visualization, cleaning, project management) = 100% done by ME ✅

## 2️⃣ Problem Statement ❗

* Issues with raw data:

  * Difficult to read CSV files
  * Hard to compare and interpret numbers

* Project Goals:

  * Analyze confirmed, recovered, and death cases 🦠
  * Calculate recovery rate 💚
  * Calculate death rate ☠️
  * Visualize trends clearly 📊

---

## 3️⃣ Dataset Description 📂

* Dataset Source: Publicly available CSV file

* Columns:

  * Date 📅
  * Country/Region 🌍
  * Confirmed 🔵
  * Recovered 💚
  * Deaths ☠️

* Data Cleaning Steps:

  * Removed missing values ✅
  * Removed duplicate rows 🗑
  * Renamed columns for consistency ✏️

---

## 4️⃣ Tools & Technologies Used 🛠️

* Programming Language: Python 🐍
* Data Analysis Library: Pandas 📊
* Visualization Libraries: Matplotlib, Seaborn 📈
* Other Tools: Google Colab, GitHub 💻

---

## 5️⃣ Methodology & Implementation 🧑‍💻

* Data Loading: Load CSV using Pandas 📥
* Data Cleaning: Handle missing & duplicate values 🧹
* Calculations:

  * Recovery Rate = (Recovered / Confirmed) × 100 💚
  * Death Rate = (Deaths / Confirmed) × 100 ☠️
* Charts & Graphs: Bar, line, and pie charts 📊
* Save & Upload: Save project files and upload to GitHub 💾

---

## 6️⃣ Results & Key Insights 📈

* Recovery rate higher than death rate in most cases 💚
* Death rate remained low compared to confirmed cases ☠️
* Peak cases observed in specific months 📅
* Visualizations made data easy to understand 🧠

---

## 7️⃣ Challenges Faced ⚡
